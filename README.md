## Introduction:

This project involved using a sample dataset from https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases to create a comprehensive report in Power BI. I focused on cleaning and integrating data from various sources, transforming it into meaningful visualisations and insights. This demonstrates my ability to handle data cleaning and visualisation tasks effectively.

## Tools and Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX Language
- M Language

## Step 1: Importing and Transforming Data using Power Query:

I utilised Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to import and transform all the tables. Then, using the Power Query Editor, I removed unnecessary columns and eliminated rows containing NULL values.
##  Step 2: Building the Star Schema and Creating a Measure Table

1. First, I created a Date table with various date formats to enable the use of Power BI's Time Intelligence features.

2. Afterwards, I switched to the model view to establish relationships between the Date table and other tables, ensuring the correct relationships were active.

3. Next, I created a Measures Table and filled it with key measures.


## Step 3: Preparing the Report

1. This step is straightforward. In Data View, I created four pages, each representing a different level of detail.

## Step 4: Creating the Sales Overview Page

1. To start the Sales Overview Page, I created three cards for Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Total Orders.

2. Following those cards, I proceeded to create a line graph depicting total sales.

3. Next, I included the summary charts.

4. After completing the summary charts, my next objective was to develop KPI visualisations. This required creating quarterly measures for revenue, profit, and orders, selected as the key performance indicators (KPIs), along with corresponding target measures.

5. Combining everything, the Sales Overview page now looks like this:

## Step 5: Creating the Customer Analysis Page

1. I created five cards: one for total customers, another for revenue per customer, a third displaying the top customer's name, a fourth showing revenue generated by the top customer, and the fifth indicating the number of orders placed by the top customer.

2. Then i created one pie chant to represent the total customers by region. 

3. Then, I designed a table to display the full names, total orders, and total revenue of various customers. (added conditional formatting to the revenue column)

4. Lastly, I placed a map to show customer location.

6. After making adjustments, the Customer Analysis Page now appears as follows:
## Step 6: Creating the Product Performance Page

1. I started this page with three gauge visualisations, each representing the quarterly targets for orders, profit, and revenue.

2. Then, I created two cards which shows the "Top product name" and "Top Product Revenue".

3. Just like the customer analysis page, I created a table for products instead of customers, featuring columns such as total revenue, total orders, and average profit per order.

4. Next, I proceeded by creating a scatter plot showing total revenue and profit margin by product name.

5. I created a stacked area chart to show the revenue by category over time.

6. Lastly, i created 2 slicers for Category and Country.

7. I completed the page resulting in a layout like this.


## Step 7: Creating the Shipping Map Page

1. I started with a Map Visualisation 

2. To make it easier for users I added a Country slicer 

3. I developed a drill-through page for shipping details that enables users to select a specific location, offering various visualisations for detailed analysis.

4. Following that, I created a shipping tooltip page featuring a visualization of the total freight.
